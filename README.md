# LinkTree
This is a bootstrap one page application for sharing links or a quick homepage base on the beautiful [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/).

Now using [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont), a font by the Brail Institute designed for greater legibility and readability while also looking great. 

To host you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). See my example [here](https://jagosw.com).
